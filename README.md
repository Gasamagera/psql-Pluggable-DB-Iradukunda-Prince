# psql-Pluggable-DB-Iradukunda-Prince

This repository contains the required documentation and screenshots for the Oracle Database Administration lab focusing on the Multitenant Architecture. The primary objective was to practice the full life cycle management of *Pluggable Databases (PDBs)* and demonstrate environment monitoring using *Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)*.

### Tasks Performed:

1.  *PDB Creation and User Provisioning:* Created a primary PDB (IR_pdb_28007) and provisioned a dedicated user (Prince_piscglauca_28007) for class work.
2.  *PDB Life Cycle Management:* Created a temporary PDB (IR_to_delete_pdb_28007) and subsequently deleted it, capturing proof of both actions.
3.  *Database Monitoring:* Configured and accessed Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) to capture the dashboard status.
